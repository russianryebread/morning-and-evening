# morning-and-evening
Spurgeon's excellent Morning and Evening Devotionals in different formats for use in web / mobile projects.

The HTML was lifted off spurgeon.org, and I didn't do anything other than remove the `spacer.gif`s and replace the images that made the first letter of each day.  My REGEX didn't change the case, so the first letter of each day needs to be capitalized if this is used in production.
